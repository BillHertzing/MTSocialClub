membership committee, work on the membership list infrastructure, how to get a form to a at-door person, how to make sure the bylaws are available, track membership start and end dates, no longer qualified (move out)list updates. How much will it cost the club to lease membership SW? is it worth it? start manual, go automated if club expands (?)
communications committee, get the word out in BuildingLink. Investigate contact list SW - the club has to notify members about annual and special meetings, plus the communications team will be spreading the word about upcoming events. Need to be fully digital - how?
finance committee, plan party budget, plan tickets cost (advance and at-door)
finance committee, work on finance infrastructure (checking account, "books", PayPal account, other digital payment options. Taking money at the door for events, at the door for memberships, and both; at the bar for drinks. Also, donations to the club. Not charitable deductions, but appreciated! Plan to coordinate with event planning committee to be sure there is good communication between planning, finance, and the caterer/bartender about responsibilities for taking money. Maybe use a ticket system?)
